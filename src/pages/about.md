Hi! I’m Rient, and I like to make dreams and software.

I’m the Principal Software Engineer  at SoftGlobal! Outside of that weighty title, I’m a Linux fan and open source-er, and tv buff. I enjoy building anything, playing music, hanging out with my family and friends, and teaching in my free time.
